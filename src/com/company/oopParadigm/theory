OOp concepts are the main ideas behind Java's oop style

these are class, object, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
and polymorphism

A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave
and what the object will contain

an object is a self contained component which consist of
methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful


Encapsulation means to hide ur data in order to make it
safe from any kind of modification
this can be achieved through:
 - declaring variables as private
 - setters and getters


Inheritance let us create new classes that share some of the attributes with
existing classes

polymorphism
let us use the same word to mean different things in different contexts
example: method overloading and method overriding

abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity
It is the process of hiding the implementation details  from the user
and only the functionality will be provided to the user
achieved via abstract classes and interfaces
